        'destination': r"C:/path/to/destination/directory1"
    },
    {
        'path': r"//server/share/path/to/source/directory2",
        'destination': r"C:/path/to/destination/directory2"
    },
    {
        'path': r"//server/share/path/to/source/file1.ext",
        'destination': r"C:/path/to/destination/directory1"
    },
    {
        'path': r"//server/share/path/to/source/file2.ext",
        'destination': r"C:/path/to/destination/directory2"
    }
